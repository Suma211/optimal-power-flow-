# optimal-power-flow

Optimal power flow (OPF) is a crucial problem in electric power systems that aims to find the optimal settings for the control variables, such as generator output levels and transformer tap ratios, to minimize the cost of generating and transmitting electrical power while satisfying various operational constraints.

In Matlab, defined the OPF problem, then formulated it, Chose the optimal solver

Set the solver options to solve the OPF problem
